# Technology Stack

## Build System

To be determined based on project requirements.

## Tech Stack

- **Primary Language**: Python (default choice for development)
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code with Kiro AI assistant
- **Platform**: Windows (cmd shell)

## Language Selection

- Use Python as the default language unless another option is significantly more efficient for the specific use case
- Prioritize simplicity and rapid prototyping

## Frameworks & Libraries

To be documented as dependencies are added.

## Common Commands

Commands will be added here as the project build system is established.

### Build
```bash
# To be defined
```

### Test
```bash
# To be defined
```

### Run
```bash

```

## Development Guidelines

- **Keep it minimal**: Prioritize minimal, prototype-focused implementations
- **Avoid over-engineering**: Write only the code necessary to solve the problem
- Use Windows-compatible commands (cmd or PowerShell syntax)
- Follow platform-specific path conventions
- Provide all responses in English
